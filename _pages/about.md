Hi! I'm an MD-PhD student at Boston University School of Medicine (started August 2021). Prior to this, I obtained my BS/BA in biological chemistry and chemistry at the University of Chicago, graduating in 2019 and working in the interim at the Rockefeller University.

My primary research interests lie in the interplay between neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, approaching this dynamic from a molecular and structural perspective. By exploring these processes as two sides of the same coin in the brain, I want to further study the mechanisms that define how they connect on a broader level to large-scale behaviors such as sleep.

You can find my CV above and [here](https://bit.ly/irenafeng-CV), and my contact info below!
