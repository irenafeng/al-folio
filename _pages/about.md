I am an MD-PhD student at Boston University School of Medicine, joining the program in 2021. Prior to this, I obtained my BS/BA in biological chemistry and chemistry at the University of Chicago.

My primary research interests lie in the interplay between neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, approaching this dynamic from a molecular and structural perspective. By exploring these processes as two sides of the same coin in the brain, I want to further study the mechanisms that define how they connect on a broader level to large-scale behaviors such as sleep.
