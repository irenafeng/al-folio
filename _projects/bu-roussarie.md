**Dr. Jean-Pierre Roussarie**, May 2022 - Present

I worked as a summer rotation student in the Roussarie Lab at Boston University School of Medicine. My project focuses on the development of an *in vitro* culture system to model ECII (entorhinal cortex layer II) neurons. Additionally, we began preliminary investigations into recapitulating patient-derived mutations and clinical phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons, to examine potential changes over the course of neurodegeneration.
